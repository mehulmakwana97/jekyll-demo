{% block position:default title:"Scheduling" %}
onCourse gives you a view of your calendars by tutor, site, room, course, class or grouped in almost any way you choose. Because these calendars are tied into the heart of your student management, they feed into training plans, payroll and attendance.

Creating a new term is as simple as duplicating a whole programme in one go, moving them forward to a new date with one action. You can have dozens of classes advertised online in a few seconds.

{% block position:default title:"Venue Management" %}
Because you can define sites linked directly to Google Maps, students and tutors are given online directions to the exact location of their class. You can even send them reminders to turn up.
Schedule times your rooms are unavailable for outside hire, and collect feedback from students as to how they liked the teaching spaces.

{% block position:default title:"The web of things" %}
onCourse is the source of information that is synchronised to student and tutor phones, Outlook calendars, a mobile friendly portal, printed reports, and wall mounted live room schedules. It powers email and SMS reminders, Google maps, and online search for 'coming soon'.
